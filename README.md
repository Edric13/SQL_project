# Introduction

This project showcases my data analysis skills using SQL, diving deep into job market data to uncover valuable insights.

# Background

During a pause in my career, I decided to explore the IT skills that the job market demands. It was the perfect time to level up my expertise and stay ahead of the curve! üí°

# Tools I Used üõ†Ô∏è

**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query databases and unearth critical insights.

**PostgreSQL**: My chosen database management system, ideal for handling job posting data.

**Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries. üíª

**Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. üìä
# Data Used üìÇ
The data I used was provided by the course i followed to complete this project from Luke Barousse
# The analysis 
1. The first analysis was focusing on the highest paying company names, IT skills and in North America as an analyst

``` sql
--which company pays the best in a role related to analytics in North America??
--what are the IT skills related to those roles? 
with job_posted_salaried as(
        SELECT *
        from job_postings_fact
        where salary_year_avg is not null
),

        select cd.name,

                inner join skills_dim as sd on sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
        where job_title_short like '% Analyst'
                and --only analyst jobs are of interest--
                job_country in ('United States', 'Canada')
                and --assuming north american jobs only
                job_location = 'Anywhere' --location anywhere withitn globe thus including N.A
        order BY salary_year_avg desc
)
select *
from top_paying_job
limit 100
``` 

2. This analysis was focused on top 5 in demand IT skills in North America and average salaries offered. 

It shows how powerful of a tool SQL is!
